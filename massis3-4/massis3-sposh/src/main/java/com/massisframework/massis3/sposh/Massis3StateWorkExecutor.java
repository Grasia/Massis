/**
 * Based on Pogamut {@link StateWorkExecutor} This class is an
 * {@link IWorkExecutor}, that considers actions to be have state, in this
 * executor, primitive is working in phases INIT, RUN*, DONE.
 * <p/>
 * Thanks to state nature of primitive, primitive is far easier to program in
 * discrete time-slice (time slice = primitive can be called multiple times
 * consequentially) nature of Pogamut. If primitive wasn't notified that it is
 * about to end, things like switching from primitive "walk" to "shoot" could be
 * troublesome. Imagine it, "walk" primitive will compute path to destination
 * and suddently new primitive "shoot" is now called. What about path the bot is
 * following? It will still follow it, although it is supposed to stop and start
 * shooting. To handle this correctlty is troublesome for few states, for many
 * states, it is madness.
 * <p/>
 * StateWorkExecutor would do this:
 * {@code ..., walk.INIT, walk.RUN*, walk.DONE, shoot.INIT, shoot.RUN*, shoot.DONE....},
 * primitive walk would have DONE called before shoot.INIT would be called,
 * allowing it to stop walking. Same thing is valid for state shoot too.
 * <p/>
 * Since we have phase DONE to cleanup some stuff before we switch to another,
 * where another can be nearly anything, what state bot should be in when DONE
 * phase is DONE. In neutral bot state (precise neutral state is defined by
 * programmer, in unreal, that would probably be standing, not shooting.).
 * <p/>
 * What if we don't want to switch to neutral bot state after primitive is DONE?
 * Don't, there is no explicit need, and in many situation it is meaningless
 * (such as primtive "enter_ducts" where bot would entering INIT in standing
 * state, but left DONE crouching).
